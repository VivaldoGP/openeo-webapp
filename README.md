# OpenEO Web App

The main goal of this project is to create a web platform to access the data generated by various space missions through the OpenEO API.

One of the main features is the generation of time series for natural resource monitoring, without the need to individually acquire or manually process the images.

It is built with Deno Fresh and consumes a Python backend using FastAPI, which interacts with the OpenEO API.
